This ship maintained regular and reliable service until 1993, when she was replaced by the much larger “original” Spirit of Tasmania.In 1997, things kicked up a notch with the introduction of the Devil Cat, a Tasmanian-built catamaran that took just six hours to travel from George Town in Tasmania’s north to Station Pier in Port Melbourne. The vessel operated during the peak season in conjunction with the original Spirit of Tasmania until 2002.In March 2002, TT-Line purchased two vessels from Superfast Ferries, a Greece-based operator servicing the Adriatic Sea. The ships, built in Turku, Finland, sailed between Italy and Greece as Superfast III & IV. In May, they travelled to the Neorion shipyard on the island of Syros for painting and general overhaul and were renamed Spirit of Tasmania I & II.The ships then made the mighty journey to Hobart, where they were refitted for their new service between Devonport and Melbourne, replacing the original Spirit of Tasmania.On 1 September, 2002 they set sail on their dual maiden voyages across Bass Strait.In 2015, the vessels underwent a major refurbishment, sporting fresh, modern interiors and stylish new facilities. In late 2017 it was announced that TT-Line will be replacing the current fleet with two custom built ships and a letter of intent signed with Flensburger Schiffbau-Gesellschaft GmbH & Co KG (FSG).",,150,"North Geelong, Victoria, Australia","Miandetta, Tasmania, Australia",,North Geelong,,,,,,maritime transportation,travel arrangements,,,"Ferry,Tourism,Tasmania,Shipping",51-200,,,,,,,,,
