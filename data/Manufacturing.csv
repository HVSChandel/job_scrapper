Kia Australia Pty Ltd,https://www.linkedin.com/company/kia-australia-pty-ltd,https://www.linkedin.com/company/384176,kia.com.au,"We believe movement inspires ideas. In pursuing new experiences, we continuously evolve and gain new motivation. Get moving. Get inspired. Founded in 1944 as Kyungsung Precision Industry, Kia is currently Korea's second largest auto manufacturer and it’s oldest. Kia is recognised as having developed Korea's first motorcycle and the country's first truck. Kia is also the first company in Korea to locally produce petrol car engines and the first domestic diesel engine. In 1979, the quality of Kia's car production was recognised when two of the world's leading European car makers chose Kia to build their 'range topper' models on their behalf - the Peugeot 604 and Fiat 132. It was in the1980's that Kia's growth really took off. In 1986 Ford joined the list of car makers who looked to Kia to produce their vehicles. The Festiva (produced by Kia) joined Ford's line up first in the USA, then across the world including Australia, where Kia produced two generations of Ford's entry-level cars. Building over 3 million vehicles a year in 14 plants across 9 countries, we pride ourselves on delivering what other car companies cannot - a remarkably diverse range of vehicles sold in over 172 countries around the world. Today, Kia Australia remains the first to offer Australia's 7-year unlimited kilometre warranty, with roadside assistance and 7 year capped priced servicing. Kia always inspires ideas.For more information visit www.kia.com.au",,170,Australia,,,,,,,,,automotive,,,,,51-200,,,,,,,,,

Align Technology designs, manufactures and markets the Invisalign® system, a proprietary method for treating malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth. Invisalign treatment corrects malocclusion using a series of clear, nearly invisible, removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position. Because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires, Invisalign treatment significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with braces.Invisalign clear aligners have been used to treat more than 15 million patients around the world and are suitable for treating both adults and teens.An orthodontist or Invisalign trained dentist will be able to advise whether Invisalign treatment is right for you. You should always read and follow their directions for use. In rare cases, allergies may occur. Align Technology also owns iTero® Intraoral scanners and OrthoCAD digital services, that help dental professionals achieve the clinical results they expect and deliver effective cutting-edge dental options to their patients.Invisalign, the Invisalign logo,  iTero, the iTero logo and ClinCheck, among others, are trademarks and/or service marks of Align Technology, Inc. or one of its subsidiaries or affiliated companies and may be registered in the U.S. and/or other countries.",,,"St Leonards, New South Wales, Australia",,,St Leonards,,,,,,medical equipment manufacturing,,,,"Invisalign® System - Comprehensive,Invisalign® System - Moderate,Invisalign® System - Lite,Invisalign® System - Express,Invisalign® System - First,Invisalign® Go,Vivera® Retainers",Self-employed,,,,,,,,,

Consequently returns from export sales have been highly significant in determining the eventual level of returns to lamb producers. In the late 1960's the situation was aggravated by a crisis in the wool industry which resulted in an increased supply of merino lambs reducing returns to producers.Ultimately, a system was devised by which the WALMB, under the powers vested in it by the Marketing of Lamb Act, as it was then known, compulsorily acquired every lamb at the point of slaughter. This enabled the WALMB to set a guaranteed purchase price for lamb which was, under the requirements of the Act, reasonably stable subject to various other factors.The WALMB's activities were in essentially administering the Act and maintaining the information systems to enable it to operate, as well as marketing of lamb and associated products.",,,"East Perth, Western Australia, Australia",,,East Perth,,,"Unit 1/3 De Vlamingh Ave, East Perth, Western Australia 6004, AU",6004,+61892620999,food and beverage manufacturing,food production,,,,Self-employed,https://facebook.com/WAMMCOInternational,,16436000,"reCAPTCHA, Ubuntu, Typekit, Sendgrid, Outlook, Mobile Friendly, Microsoft Office 365, Google Maps (Non Paid Users), Google Maps, Google Font API, Google Analytics, Bootstrap Framework, Apache",,,,,

At no time what I've been doing has ever been an obligation, it was simply love for the earth – the simple elements that combined, infuse you with those flavours.Now I have the privilege to write another page in our history, and to share my family’s passion with all of you.",,,Australia,,,,,,,,,food and beverage manufacturing,,,,,Self-employed,,,,,,,,,
