Let’s be frank, selling and buying property is *stressful.*While selling or buying a home often represents a new life chapter, there’s no denying that the decision is often spurred on (and complicated) by some of life’s biggest challenges and milestones. Things like getting married, expecting a baby, an ever-growing family, or not-so-happy occasions like separation or losing a loved one can all trigger the next step on the property journey.Selling a home is a big deal, and, it’s not until you start the process that you realise just how overwhelming it truly can be. This is why it’s the first problem we set out to solve. We started in 2013 with the goal of improving transparency around real estate and making it easier to find a trusted real estate agent. Choosing an agent can sometimes feel like a game of chance. We remove the guesswork by putting the powerful tools of knowledge, insight and choice in a vendor’s hands. Every vendor’s story is different, but we know that no matter what your home-selling journey looks like, we can help.We work with thousands of quality agents right across Australia so, if you're selling your property, OpenAgent is the place to go to find an agent you trust and get the support you need.We're an Australian-based team with a bucketload of passion for the work we do.
