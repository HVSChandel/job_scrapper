Invisalign treatment corrects malocclusion using a series of clear, nearly invisible, removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position. Because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires, Invisalign treatment significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with braces.Invisalign clear aligners have been used to treat more than 15 million patients around the world and are suitable for treating both adults and teens.An orthodontist or Invisalign trained dentist will be able to advise whether Invisalign treatment is right for you.

For 40 years, the community has come to our centre to meet, receive care, seek advice, socialise and celebrate.In 1994, we received funding from the Victorian Department of Human Services to share its knowledge across the state, and the Centre for Culture, Ethnicity and Health (CEH) was formed. In the last 21 years, CEH has continued to develop their expertise in health and wellbeing, human rights, cultural competence and health literacy.North Richmond Community Health’s current building opened in late 2012. At that time, North Richmond Community Health was given the honour of an Aboriginal name by Wurundjeri Senior Elder Doreen Garvey-Wandin: Wulempuri-Kertheba, which translates from Woi wurrung as ‘staying healthy together’.As an organisation, we pride ourselves on our commitment to working with refugees, asylum seekers, newly-arrived migrants, people of different cultural and linguistic backgrounds, people who inject drugs and people of all socio-economic backgrounds.We are constantly reiterating that commitment and developing it.North Richmond Community Health has a long history, with many relationships in the community going back 40 years.

Danila Dilba Health Service is an Aboriginal community-controlled organisation providing culturally-appropriate, comprehensive primary health care and community services to Biluru (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander) people in the Yilli Rreung (greater Darwin) region of the Northern Territory.The name Danila Dilba Biluru Butji Binnilutlum was given by the Larrakia people, who are the traditional owners of Darwin and Palmerston. In the Larrakia language Danila Dilba means ‘dilly bag used to collect bush medicines’ and Biluru Butji Binnilutlum means ‘blackfella (Aboriginal people) getting better from sickness’.Our logo was designed by Larrakia elder Reverend Wally Fejo. The story of the logo is: “The fish being in a school are excited when jumping around and convey to us our exciting, healthy life. The turtle represents the people going back to lay her eggs. The stick represents a hunting tool on how to find her eggs. The overall circle is like looking inside a dilly bag from above. The snake brings the threat of danger to our wellbeing and reminds us that we should always sustain ourselves and be on our guard for health.”Biluru is a Larrakia word that collectively describes Aboriginal people who are living in or visiting the Yilli Rreung Region.",,100,"Darwin City, Northern Territory, Australia",,,Darwin City,,,,,,hospitals and health care,,,,"Primary Health Care Service,Community Services",51-200,,,,,,,,,
