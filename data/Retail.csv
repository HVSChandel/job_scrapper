Dan looked around one day and decided: I can run this better than my father. So he did, setting up a store only a few hundred meters away.Dan immediately began doing things differently. He bought in bulk and sourced many of his wines directly from overseas. He wrote stories and reviews about his wines, he held social functions and started a wine club. Dan Murphy’s retail concept was simple: offer the most extensive range at the lowest prices possible, add a passionate enthusiasm for what you sell, and you’ve got an unbeatable offer.That's the Dan Murphy tradition that continues today in over 170 stores around Australia.If you have never been to a Dan Murphy’s store, you are in for a rewarding experience.

Well, it's a long story, full of twists and turns, action and adventures. There are even a few scary bits. But seeing as you asked... why don't you pull up a metaphoric chair around my metaphoric fire and I'll tell you the story of BlackMilk... Several years ago I was broke, bored and rather cold. At that point most people would have got a job and a beanie, but not I. For some reason I decided to buy a sewing machine and make myself a shirt. I still have no idea why. So I went into a big fabric shop and looked at all the different fabrics they had - but after buying a second hand sewing machine, I only had six bucks in my pocket, which meant I had to get the cheapest fabric they had - nylon lining. It was these fateful decisions that lead me down the path to BlackMilk. Because nylon lining doesn't look particularly attractive, it meant I had to make it fitted. I made myself a tight shirt. It was tragic. The stitching was wrong, the pieces were cut weird, and the neck was a nothing more than a hole. And I loved it. I wore it constantly.From that moment, things changed. I was doing odd jobs, but at the back of my mind I was plotting and planning. If I got ten bucks it wasn't just ten bucks ... it was half a metre of printed fabric. Three dollars was a new packet of needles. A hundred bucks meant I could get my machine fixed.Want to keep reading our little story...? https://blackmilkclothing.com/pages/black-milks-story",2009,53,"Nudgee Beach, Queensland, Australia",,,Brisbane,,,"463 tufnell rd, brisbane, queensland 4014, au",4014,+61 416 083 080,retail apparel and fashion,apparel and fashion,,,"Fashion,Ecommerce,Retail,Manufacturing,Design,Alternative Fashion",51-200,"https://twitter.com/BlackMilkTweets, https://www.facebook.com/blackmilkclothing","ecommerce, design, retail, manufacturing, accessories, fashion, shopping, men's clothing, women's clothing",5000000,,,,,,354417,,,
