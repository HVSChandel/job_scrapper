We aim to help children enjoy the transforming work of Christ through Christian love and grace as they learn about His ways. In today’s society it is essential that our children develop an understanding of who they are in Christ and a Biblical world-view as the basis for their self-worth. We have seen for many years that esteem based in God allows the students to reflect integrity, honesty, tolerance and compassion for others which is the very heart of God.
